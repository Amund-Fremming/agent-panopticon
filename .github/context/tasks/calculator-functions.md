# Task: Calculator Functions - Addition and Subtraction

## Overview
Create calculator functions in Rust for basic arithmetic operations: addition and subtraction.

## Requirements
1. Create an `add` function that takes two numbers and returns their sum
2. Create a `subtract` function that takes two numbers and returns their difference
3. Functions should handle integer types (i32)
4. Functions must be well-documented with doc comments
5. Complete test coverage for both functions including edge cases
6. All tests must pass

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `add` function implemented and working correctly
- [ ] `subtract` function implemented and working correctly
- [ ] Functions are properly documented with doc comments and examples
- [ ] Unit tests cover normal cases (positive numbers)
- [ ] Unit tests cover edge cases (zero, negative numbers, boundary values)
- [ ] All tests execute successfully and pass
- [ ] Code follows Rust best practices and idioms

## Priority
High

## Dependencies
